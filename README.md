# The P Transformation

We have implemented in Maude the P transformation using Maude's meta-level facilities.

The entire transformation mechanism consists of two components:

- The "Transformation" component implements the P transformation and includes the probability distribution library. 
- The "Simulation" component applies the simulation transformation to the resulting module and also includes an extensible sampling library.
